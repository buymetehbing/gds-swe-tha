## About me 👋🏼

Hi there, I'm Vivienne Ching, a penultimate year undergraduate studying computer science and economics at NTU. To me, software development is an area that truly excites me as it provides me with a canvas to express my creativity while simultaneously challenging my problem-solving skills. 

My journey in this field has been enriched with diverse experiences and I've undertaken internships covering software development and project management. I thrive in fast-paced environments, where the rhythm not only excites me but also fuels my hunger for more challenges. 😋❤️‍🔥
