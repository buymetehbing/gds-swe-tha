## About me 👋🏼

Hi there, I'm Vivienne Ching, a penultimate year undergraduate studying computer science and economics at NTU. To me, software development is an area that truly excites me as it provides me with a canvas to express my creativity while simultaneously challenging my problem-solving skills. 

My journey in this field has been enriched with diverse experiences and I've undertaken internships covering software development and project management. I thrive in fast-paced environments, where the rhythm not only excites me but also fuels my hunger for more challenges. 😋❤️‍🔥

The role I applied for: 'Tech - Software Engineer : GovSupply & GovWallet'.

Why? I am genuinely enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to cutting-edge projects that play a key role in advancing digital government services. The opportunity to work on meaningful initiatives, particularly those aimed at addressing the needs of both digitally-savvy citizens and individuals facing challenges in adopting digital solutions, deeply resonates with my professional aspirations. I am drawn to projects that not only leverage technology for innovation but also prioritize inclusivity and accessibility. 

I am confident that my technical skills, coupled with my passion for creating meaningful solutions, make me a valuable candidate for this internship. And so, I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the success of GovWallet and GovSupply! 😆
